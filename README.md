# SentriNet
 
A **virtual enterprise security lab simulating real-world cloud-hybrid network**s with secure user access control and multi-factor authentication workflows. It integrates active monitoring and incident response using open-source **SIEM tools for SOC operations**.

This project demonstrates the provisioning of users and role-based access control in a simulated enterprise domain, alongside the configuration of Security Onion and Wazuh to handle over 1000 daily events. It includes team-based development of customizable security playbooks, supporting incident documentation and automated response within a controlled virtual SOC environment.
